Vim?
----

Vim is a text editor, a modal one.

Pronounced like like "Jim" (and not vee-eye-em).

A clone of vi.



A Brief history of Vim.
-----------------------

vi created by Bill Joy in 1976.

Gets its name from the unambigous abbreviation for the command visual.

Clones - Elvis, Stevie, nvi.

Vim written by Bram MOolenaar in 1991.

Based on Stevie.

Originally stood for Vi IMitation later changed to Vi IMproved.

"vi introduced the standard from which others borrowed (vile, elvis, nvi), and Vim took the baton and ran with it."




Why in world must I use something archaic?
------------------------------------------


- Modal Editing. PERIOD!

  "A Modal interface in the hands of an experienced and non-fickle person can be extremely efficient." - Stackoverflow user.

  Everyone's first vi session.

- A "Language" of Text Editing (Steve Losh)
 
  "...it is available in nearly identical form on every modern Unix system, thus providing a kind of text-editing lingua franca."   - Learing the vi and Vim Editors, OReilly.

    Verbs and nouns.

    Adjectives.

    Sentences.
