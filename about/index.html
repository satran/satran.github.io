<h1 class="title">About</h1>

I love to code. I have been coding from when I was in the fourth grade. It was LOGO then. From then I have been coding in various languages. BASIC to C, C++, Java, Perl, Php, Python and JavaScript, to name a few, are the languages I have worked with. I am most proficient in Python, which is what I use every day. Lately I have been coding in C quite a bit. I have done a fair amount of JavaScript too. The other languages are sitting like dormant volcanoes in my brain waiting to erupt in a new project or so.
