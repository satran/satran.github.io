    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>I love to code. I have been coding from when I was in the fourth grade. It was LOGO then. But from then I have been coding in various languages. BASIC to C, C++, Java, Perl, Php, Python and JavaScript, to name a few, are the languages I have worked with. I am most proficient in Python, which is what I use every day. I like JavaScript and have toyed around with it for quite some time now. The other languages are sitting like dormant volcanoes in my brain waiting to erupt in a new project or so.</p>

    <p>I love to tweak around with computers. I remember my first own computer having 120Mb of hard disk, which I tweaked and eventually crashed. I currently own a MacBook Pro, use OS X Mountain Lion on it. Though I find the system to do all what I need my favourite OS would be Fedora, a GNU/Linux flavour, which you might see as the child of the very popular Red Hat Enterprise Linux. I like customizing the things that I work on, even on a Mac I managed to find something to customize.</p>

    <p>I use <a href="http://www.iterm2.com/">iTerm2</a> as my terminal which runs on a zsh. I have configured it using <a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh">ohmyzsh</a> with gallois as my default theme. I have modified it to fit my needs.</p>

    <p>Text editing should be simple. You should not be jumping from using the keyboard to the mouse to do simple tasks. Your editor should give you all things you need so you don't leave the keyboard. Well that is my way of doing things. And for this I have Vim set up to my comfort. I use <a href="https://github.com/b4winckler/macvim">MacVim</a> and Vim from the terminal. I have two favourite colour schemes. One of them is tutticolori show below.</p>

    <p>And the other is rdark as shown below. I use rdark for the terminal and tutticolori for MacVim. Both of them have been modified. If you like the color scheme you can find it in my <a href="https://github.com/satyajitranjeev/Dotvim">DotVim</a> repository. This repository also holds all my settings and the plugins I use. Feel free to fork it or clone it.</p>

    <p>I started blogging using wordress. Wordpress was great initially, it was easy. But once I wanted to customize it, it just became too much of a task. And for every feature they have a price tag. So I decided to go for tumblr. Tumblr has got great customizability and supported Markdown syntax but I noticed that at times my site was not reachable. I began my search of a place to host it. I decided to host in on my own, but with it came with problems of its own. Then my good friend <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/Debloper">Soumya Deb</a> suggested that I give <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> a shot. I was curious - static pages generated from Markdown. I did my research on static site generators and narrowed my options to <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> and <a href="http://ringce.com/hyde">Hyde</a>. One in Ruby and the other in Python. Naturally my love for Python initially made me choose Hyde. Sadly Jekyll had a better support on GitHub.</p>

    <p>So Jekyll it was. The <a href="https://github.com/satyajitranjeev/satyajitranjeev.github.com">source code</a> of the site is on GitHub as you might imagine. The concept is using <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub pages</a>. GitHub automatically generates html every time you push your code to the repository, the one you have configured as your page. Jekyll has a good wiki where you can figure out how to get started. You might also want to check out <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub pages</a> to understand how Jekyll works with GitHub.</p>

    <p>I keep trying out new technology, sometimes old ones too. Pop in here once a while and you might notice something that would pique your curiosity. </p>
