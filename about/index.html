It is quite difficult to keep up to track with changes in life. I developed a simple Go application to generate my resume from yaml files. I hope to make some sort of a timeline with the same tool. Currently the project resides in <a href="https://github.com/satran/resume">Github</a>. You can find the generated page at <a href="/resume">/resume</a>.
