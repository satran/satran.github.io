I do realize this is the third time I am shifting my blog. But this had to be done. I needed a simpler solution to get my blog running. As mentioned in the [About](/about) page the whole site is generated using [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and pushed into [GitHub](https://github.com/). The simplicity of it is just marvellous. I just have to create a markdown file in the `_posts` directory and push it to GiHub's repository. 

There are definitely glitches in moving the blog. The URL's don't match. I have reposted the few articles that were posted on Tumblr. My apologies for that.
