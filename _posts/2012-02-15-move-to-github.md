title: Move to GitHub
summary: I do realize this is the third time I am shifting my blog. But this had to be done. I needed a simpler solution to get my blog running. As mentioned in the About page the whole site is generated using Jekyll and pushed into GitHub. The simplicity of it is just marvellous. I just have to create a markdown file in the `_posts` directory and push it to GiHub's repository.

I do realize this is the third time I am shifting my blog. But this had to be done. I needed a simpler solution to get my blog running. As mentioned in the [About](/about) page the whole site is generated using [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and pushed into [GitHub](https://github.com/). The simplicity of it is just marvellous. I just have to create a markdown file in the `_posts` directory and push it to GiHub's repository. 

There are definitely glitches in moving the blog. The URL's don't match. I have reposted the few articles that were posted on Tumblr. My apologies for that.
