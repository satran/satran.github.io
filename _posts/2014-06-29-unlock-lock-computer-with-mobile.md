title: Unlock and Lock your Computer with a Mobile
summary: 
---

When I forget to lock my laptop someone at work graciously decides to post a message on Facebook or Twitter on my behalf. And when that happens you might see "I'm depressed. I want to kill myself." or "I feel like running naked in front of the all women's college." in my timeline. But remembering to lock the system just doesn't happen naturally. The autolock does not work either as one can jump on my system before the inactivity kicks in. The last Apple developer conference gave me the idea to try using the bluetooth of my mobile to do the same.

Initially I had written a shell script to do the same. But with my limited knowledge in shell scripting I decided to write it in Go.

You can get the code in my [Github repository](https://github.com/satran/autolock).
