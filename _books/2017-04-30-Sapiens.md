I'm a little undecided about the book. There were times I did not want to keep the book down and times I could not pick it up. I enjoyed some chapters and some of the author's conclusions. The others I could not digest for the lack of empirical evidence. The book is highly opinionated. If you want to know the history of man kind this is probably not the book you want to read. This book gives you a bit of history and the author's opinions on how or why things happened. It is a fairly enjoyable read though.
