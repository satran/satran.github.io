This was quite a quick read. I stumbled across this book while searching for one that would provide me with a basic understanding of the terminologies in Kubernetes. It just does that. There are no frills and it is quite the most straight forward book I have read. The author's language is interesting and provides you with a bit of humour at times. 

The fact that it is provided for free on the OpenShift website makes it a must read if you are trying to understand about Kubernetes. You can get a copy [here](https://www.openshift.com/promotions/kubernetes.html).
